# Google Open Source Support Policies

This repository contains a summary of the support policies adopted by several
Google Open Source projects.  Please keep the following in mind:

1. Not all Google projects have adopted these policies. Consult the 
   documentation of each project to find out what their policies are.
2. The source of truth for these policies are the [pages][policies-link] 
   published at https://opensource.google/
3. The published policies describe general principles to support and stop
   supporting operating systems, runtimes, and language versions. They do 
   **not** describe the current support matrix at any point in time.
4. This repository summarizes the support matrix if one follows said principles.
   It provides a central place to clarify the effect of following the support
   principles.
